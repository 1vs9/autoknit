TODO List + Notes
=================

Slice passing is starting to actually work pretty well.

ak-build_next_active_chains will assert() in append_ev when there is a loop with exactly one stitch.
 --> Not fixing, because earlier code should *not* allow this situation to arise (really broken)

ak-peel_slice will sometimes create a disconnected next chain (one that doesn't contain a time function maximum)
 --> Should fix by checking that each next chain contains a bind-off location [time function maximum, I guess? could also just tag edges]
  This will require some changes to level_chains, as well as the time fn being passed to peel_slice.

No code yet to actually accumulate stitches and links through the steps. Minimally, build_next_active_chains needs to provide a source (chain,stitch) for each next_active_stitches element.
Fancier/easier would be to assign a unique ID to each (non-discarded) active/next Stitch and make sure these get tracked.
